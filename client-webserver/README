In this directory are tools that will run on webservers for sysadmins to
automatically obtain their certs


Set CHOCOLATESERVER environment variable for "make deploy" and client.py!


chocolate.py - server-side, requires web.py (python-webpy),
        PyCrypto (python-crypto), redis, python-redis, python-protobuf
	probably wants to run under a web server like lighttpd with fastcgi

client.py - experimental tool for making requests and parsing replies

chocolate_protocol.proto - protocol definition; needs protobuf-compiler

sni_challenge -
	Assumes Apache server with name based virtual hosts is running 
	(for intended address).
	Call perform_sni_cert_challenge(address, r, nonce) to do the whole 
	challenge.
	Example code is given in main method
	Right now requires full path specification of CSR/KEY in the Global 
	Variables (how should this be specified?)
