In this directory is a reference CA implementation of the Chocolate protocol,
DV and signing mechanism.

Set CHOCOLATESERVER environment variable for "make deploy"!


chocolate.py - server-side, requires web.py (python-webpy),
        PyCrypto (python-crypto) 2.3 (not 2.1!!), redis, python-redis,
        python-protobuf, python-nss
	probably wants to run under a web server like lighttpd with fastcgi


chocolate_protocol.proto - protocol definition; needs protobuf-compiler

sni_challenge -
	Assumes Apache server with name based virtual hosts is running 
	(for intended address).
	Call perform_sni_cert_challenge(address, r, nonce) to do the whole 
	challenge.
	Example code is given in main method
	Right now requires full path specification of CSR/KEY in the Global 
	Variables (how should this be specified?)
